# DATA CLEANING

I cleaned the data in order to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis. I checked for missing and null data and realized there was some null data I needed to remove. I used Excel and Power query to cleaning the datasets.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

After analyzing and cleaning the datasets. Some of the columns from the 11 tables were grouped to get unique insights and visualize them:

-Raised amount by Region: The top 5 region with the most highest amount raised.

-Raised amount by funding rounds type: What is the ideal type of funding rounds?

-Raised amount by Institution: Which institution produced the highest startup investment?

-Largest investment in African startup.

-Funding rounds by Founders: What is the name of the founder with the highest startup?

# DATA VISUALIZATION

After Exploring the data, I visualized on Power BI.
